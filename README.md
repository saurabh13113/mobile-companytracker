University assignment to track a mobile company and its customers including a visualizer to do the same.

Refer to Documentation.pdf to see documentation about the assignment and its relevant methods.

Access the applicataion by running application.py, following which launches the visualizer and all assosciated files.
Use C to filter by Customer ID, D to filter by duration of call, L to filter by Location of call, R to reset, and M to filter by month.

These filters are applied and showed visually from in the application as blue lines from the caller to the reciever, shown on a map of Toronto. This allows the user easier access and interpretation of the call logs and records, the data is from the dataset.json file. Feel free to use another JSON file as data but make sure to format.
